# 10 – Code Style & Quality Principles

## Language & Tooling
- TypeScript strict mode (`strict: true`) across the repo.
- ESLint (next/core-web-vitals preset) + Prettier for formatting; errors fail CI.
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits; lint-staged enforces `eslint --fix` & `prettier --write` on changed files.

## File & Function Guidelines
- Max 500 LOC per file → refactor into smaller modules or hooks if exceeded.
- Aim for ≤ 50 LOC per React component/hook (excluding type defs).
- 1 public export per file when reasonable; collocate tests next to source (`Foo.tsx` + `Foo.test.tsx`).

## Naming
- Files & folders: kebab-case (`reading-card.tsx`).
- React components: PascalCase.
- Hooks: `use` prefix & camelCase (`useReadingStats`).
- Variables: descriptive, no abbreviations (`currentIndex`, not `idx`).

## Comments & Documentation
- JSDoc3 for all exported functions, hooks, and complex logic.
- Focus on **why** and **how**, not obvious **what**.
- Use single-line `//` comments for quick context, multi-line `/** ... */` for bigger picture.
- Never delete still-relevant comments; update them alongside code.

## Best Practices
- Prefer pure functions and declarative React patterns.
- Avoid shared mutable state; use immutable updates.
- No `any` types; use unknown → refinement or proper generics.
- Early return to reduce nesting; guard clauses over deep `if` ladders.
- Destructure props & state at top of component.
- Use optional chaining & nullish coalescing instead of verbose checks.

## Testing & Coverage
- Vitest + React Testing Library for unit/component tests.
- 95%+ lines & branches coverage on core logic (reading scoring, adaptive algo).
- Avoid testing implementation details; test behaviour & DOM.

## Tooling Scripts
```
"lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx",
"format": "prettier --write .",
"test": "vitest run --coverage",
"type-check": "tsc --noEmit"
```

## Continuous Improvement
- Run `--fix` + `--write` pre-commit; CI double-checks.
- Refactor when code smells exceed boy-scout threshold.
- PR reviews enforce these rules; blockers until resolved.
