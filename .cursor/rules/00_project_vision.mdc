# 00 – Project Vision & Structure

## Vision
- Build an offline-first web application "German A2 Reading Trainer" that delivers exam-style reading practice with Apple-level polish.
- Delight learners with instant feedback, adaptive difficulty, and clear progress insights, all without relying on external servers or APIs.
- Maintain a lean codebase (< 500 LOC per file) that new contributors can grok in minutes.

## Scope & Non-Goals
- IN: Reading exercises, local progress tracking, adaptive text difficulty, dashboard analytics.
- OUT: Speaking/listening modules, cloud sync, user accounts, third-party analytics, monetization.

## Technical Stack (researched • 2025-06-12)
- Next.js 15.1.8 (latest stable) + React 18 + TypeScript.
- UI: Tailwind CSS v3 (JIT) for rapid theming + Headless UI for accessible primitives.
- State: React Context or lightweight Zustand (no heavy Redux).
- Storage: IndexedDB via localForage; fall back to localStorage for small keys.

## High-Level Directory Layout
```
/README_PRD.txt           ← living spec & progress log
/.cursor/rules/           ← project-wide rules (this folder)
/src/
  components/             ← reusable UI atoms & molecules
  features/               ← vertical slices (reading, dashboard…)
  lib/                    ← shared helpers (storage, i18n, utils)
  pages/ or app/          ← Next.js routing layer (App Router)
  styles/                 ← global Tailwind config & CSS
  tests/                  ← Vitest + React Testing Library specs
/public/                  ← static assets (icons, sample data…)
```

## Incremental Roadmap (0-100%)
1. Bootstrap Next.js + Tailwind template (10%).
2. Implement "Hello Reading" exercise with hard-coded text (25%).
3. Local storage of attempts + stats (40%).
4. Adaptive difficulty selector & dashboard (60%).
5. Polish, animations, accessibility, dark mode (80%).
6. QA, tests, performance pass (<1 s TTI) (100%).

## Collaboration Principles
- PRD is the single source of truth. Update it after every major milestone.
- Tasks tracked via GitHub issues with clear acceptance criteria.
- No code merges without passing CI (type-check, lint, tests ≥ 95% coverage).
