# 30 – UI / UX Principles

## Apple-Level Polish
- Pixel-perfect spacing & typography: 4-pt baseline grid.
- Motion with purpose: 200-250 ms ease-out transitions; no gratuitous animations.
- Haptic-style feedback (visual): subtle button press scaling (98%).

## Layout & Responsiveness
- Mobile-first; support ≥ 320 px width.
- Use CSS Grid/Flex for adaptive layouts; no horizontal scroll.
- Max line-length 65-75 ch for reading comprehension texts.
- Dashboard cards snap to 12-column layout on ≥ 1024 px.

## Accessibility
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance.
- Semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`).
- ARIA roles only when semantics insufficient.
- Visible focus outlines; contrast ≥ 4.5:1.
- Prefers-reduced-motion honouring.

## Visual Language
- Primary palette: neutral grayscale + accent "Goethe blue" (#0080FF).
- Tailwind custom theme tokens (`--color-primary`, etc.).
- Icons: Heroicons outline 24 px; filled variant on active.
- Light & dark themes; auto-detect via `prefers-color-scheme`.

## Interaction Patterns
- Tap targets ≥ 44 × 44 px.
- Single-action per screen where possible; avoid modal overload.
- Undo snackbar for destructive actions.
- Keyboard shortcuts (⌘/Ctrl+← → navigate questions).

## Reading Exercise UX
- One text per screen with scroll; questions pinned bottom.
- Immediate feedback after answer selection (green/red outline + explanation).
- Progress bar at top shows #questions left.
- Exit confirmation when mid-exercise.

## Dashboard UX
- Overview: streak, accuracy %, recent texts.
- Insight cards are clickable, leading to detailed drill-down pages.
- Badge achievements with celebratory micro-animations (confetti SVG, reduced-motion respectful).

## Content Authoring Experience
- Hidden "editor" mode toggled via URL `?edit=1` for quick text creation.
- Inline validation of A2 vocabulary using Goethe wordlist.

## Copy & Tone
- German UI with subtle English tooltips for clarity.
- Concise, friendly tone; avoid jargon.
- Empty states guide next action with illustration.

## Usability Testing Checklist
- First-time user completes exercise in < 60 s without hints.
- All flows usable with keyboard only.
- Screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA) announces question context and options.
- Colour-blind simulation passes (no sole reliance on colour cues).

## Continuous UX Improvement
- Heuristic review every milestone.
- Collect voluntary local feedback logs; prompt export as JSON.
- Iterate micro-copy based on observed confusion points.
