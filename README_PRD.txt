# German A2 Reading Trainer - Product Requirements & Progress Tracker

## Problem Statement
German language learners preparing for Goethe Institut A2 certification struggle 
with effective reading comprehension practice. 
Current study materials are either too generic, fail to match actual exam formats, 
or provide boring, repetitive exercises that feel like a chore rather than engaging practice. 
Students lack structured feedback on their progress and have difficulty identifying specific areas for improvement.

## Target User
German language learners at intermediate beginner level preparing for Goethe Institut A2 certification exam, 
specifically focusing on the reading comprehension component. 
These users have basic German vocabulary and grammar knowledge but need targeted practice 
to build confidence and accuracy for the exam format.
